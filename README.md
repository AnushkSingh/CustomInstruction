# CustomInstruction
Design a custom instruction for a given equation in compiler.
This project implements a Lex/Flex-based lexical analyzer that processes mathematical expressions and computes results using custom-defined instructions for AI/ML workloads. The program recognizes variables (xN, yN), mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, =), and the keyword "compute" to execute the equation: z = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
